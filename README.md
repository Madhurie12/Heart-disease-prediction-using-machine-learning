# HEART_DISEASE_PREDICTION
Unleashing machine learning's potential, it predicts heart disease by decoding age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, and exercise data. Empowering early intervention, it charts a path to heart-healthy lives.
This project aims to predict the risk of heart disease using logistic regression, a popular machine-learning algorithm. By analyzing a range of medical factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and exercise habits, the model provides accurate predictions on the likelihood of heart disease.

## Features:

1. **Logistic Regression**: The project utilizes logistic regression to build a predictive model for heart disease.
2. **Dataset**: The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of medical records of individuals, including various health parameters and the presence or absence of heart disease.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and categorical variable encoding, to ensure optimal model performance.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: The logistic regression model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. **Prediction**: Once trained, the model can make predictions on new, unseen data to assess the risk of heart disease for an individual.

## Usage:

1. Install the necessary dependencies, including Python and relevant libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas.
2. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
3. Load the dataset and preprocess it using the provided functions.
4. Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. Train the logistic regression model on the training set.
6. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using various metrics.
7. Use the trained model to make predictions on new data for heart disease risk assessment.
